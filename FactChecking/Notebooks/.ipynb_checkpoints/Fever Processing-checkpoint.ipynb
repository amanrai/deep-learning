In addition to the old forms of artistic expression such as fashion and gastronomy , new modes of expression are being considered as arts such as video , computer art , performance , advertising , animation , television and videogames .   The history of art is a multidisciplinary branch of the arts and sciences , seeking an objective examination of art throughout time , classifying cultures , establishing periodizations , and observing the distinctive and influential characteristics of art . The study of the history of art was initially developed during the Renaissance , with its limited scope being the artistic production of Western civilization . However , as time has passed , it has imposed a broader view of artistic history , seeking a comprehensive overview of all the civilizations and analysis of their artistic production in terms of their own cultural values -LRB- cultural relativism -RRB- , and not just western art history .   Today , art enjoys a wide network of study , dissemination and preservation of all the artistic legacy of mankind throughout history . The 20th century has seen the proliferation of institutions , foundations , art museums and galleries , in both the public and private sectors , dedicated to the analysis and cataloging of works of art as well as exhibitions aimed at a mainstream audience . The rise of media has been crucial in improving the study and dissemination of art . International events and exhibitions like the Whitney Biennial and biennales of Venice and São Paulo or the Documenta of Kassel have helped the development of new styles and trends . Prizes such as the Turner of the Tate Gallery , the Wolf Prize in Arts , the Pritzker Prize of architecture , the Pulitzer of photography and the Oscar of cinema also promote the best creative work on an international level .

Chad has several regions : a desert zone in the north , an arid Sahelian belt in the centre and a more fertile Sudanian Savanna zone in the south . Lake Chad , after which the country is named , is the largest wetland in Chad and the second-largest in Africa . The capital N'Djamena is the largest city .   Chad 's official languages are Arabic and French . Chad is home to over 200 different ethnic and linguistic groups . The religions of Chad are Islam -LRB- at 55 % -RRB- , followed by Christianity -LRB- at 40 % -RRB- .   Beginning in the 7th millennium BC , human populations moved into the Chadian basin in great numbers . By the end of the 1st millennium BC , a series of states and empires had risen and fallen in Chad 's Sahelian strip , each focused on controlling the trans-Saharan trade routes that passed through the region . France conquered the territory by 1920 and incorporated it as part of French Equatorial Africa . In 1960 , Chad obtained independence under the leadership of François Tombalbaye . Resentment towards his policies in the Muslim north culminated in the eruption of a long-lasting civil war in 1965 . In 1979 the rebels conquered the capital and put an end to the south 's hegemony . However , the rebel commanders fought amongst themselves until Hissène Habré defeated his rivals . He was overthrown in 1990 by his general Idriss Déby . Since 2003 the Darfur crisis in Sudan has spilt over the border and destabilised the nation , with hundreds of thousands of Sudanese refugees living in and around camps in eastern Chad . Unsustainable high birth rates and a lack of agriculture let the country persist in poverty .   While many political parties are active , power lies firmly in the hands of President Déby and his political party , the Patriotic Salvation Movement . Chad remains plagued by political violence and recurrent attempted coups d'état . Chad is one of the poorest and most corrupt countries in the world ; most inhabitants live in poverty as subsistence herders and farmers . Since 2003 crude oil has become the country 's primary source of export earnings , superseding the traditional cotton industry . \", 'id': 'Chad'}\n",

The critical success of the album Shotgun Willie -LRB- 1973 -RRB- , combined with the critical and commercial success of Red Headed Stranger -LRB- 1975 -RRB- and Stardust -LRB- 1978 -RRB- , made Nelson one of the most recognized artists in country music . He was one of the main figures of outlaw country , a subgenre of country music that developed in the late 1960s as a reaction to the conservative restrictions of the Nashville sound . Nelson has acted in over 30 films , co-authored several books , and has been involved in activism for the use of biofuels and the legalization of marijuana .   Born during the Great Depression , and raised by his grandparents , Nelson wrote his first song at age seven and joined his first band at ten . During high school , he toured locally with the Bohemian Polka as their lead singer and guitar player . After graduating from high school in 1950 , he joined the Air Force but was later discharged due to back problems . After his return , Nelson attended Baylor University for two years but dropped out because he was succeeding in music . During this time , he worked as a disc jockey in Texas radio stations and a singer in honky-tonks . Nelson moved to Vancouver , Washington , where he wrote `` Family Bible '' and recorded the song `` Lumberjack '' in 1956 . In 1958 , he moved to Houston , Texas , after signing a contract with D Records . He sang at the Esquire Ballroom weekly and he worked as a disk jockey . During that time , he wrote songs that would become country standards , including `` Funny How Time Slips Away '' , `` Hello Walls '' , `` Pretty Paper '' , and `` Crazy '' . In 1960 he moved to Nashville , Tennessee , and later signed a publishing contract with Pamper Music which allowed him to join Ray Price 's band as a bassist . In 1962 , he recorded his first album , ... And Then I Wrote . Due to this success , Nelson signed in 1964 with RCA Victor and joined the Grand Ole Opry the following year . After mid-chart hits in the late 1960s and the early 1970s , Nelson retired in 1972 and moved to Austin , Texas . The ongoing music scene of Austin motivated Nelson to return from retirement , performing frequently at the Armadillo World Headquarters .   In 1973 , after signing with Atlantic Records , Nelson turned to outlaw country , including albums such as Shotgun Willie and Phases and Stages . In 1975 , he switched to Columbia Records , where he recorded the critically acclaimed album Red Headed Stranger . The same year , he recorded another outlaw country album , Wanted ! The Outlaws , along with Waylon Jennings , Jessi Colter , and Tompall Glaser . During the mid-1980s , while creating hit albums like Honeysuckle Rose and recording hit songs like `` On the Road Again '' , `` To All the Girls I 've Loved Before '' , and `` Pancho and Lefty '' , he joined the country supergroup The Highwaymen , along with fellow singers Johnny Cash , Waylon Jennings , and Kris Kristofferson .   In 1990 , Nelson 's assets were seized by the Internal Revenue Service , which claimed that he owed . The difficulty of paying his outstanding debt was aggravated by weak investments he had made during the 1980s . In 1992 , Nelson released The IRS Tapes : Who 'll Buy My Memories ? ; the profits of the double album -- destined to the IRS -- and the auction of Nelson 's assets cleared his debt . During the 1990s and 2000s , Nelson continued touring extensively , and released albums every year . Reviews ranged from positive to mixed . He explored genres such as reggae , blues , jazz , and folk . Nelson made his first movie appearance in the 1979 film The Electric Horseman , followed by other appearances in movies and on television . Nelson is a major liberal activist and the co-chair of the advisory board of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws -LRB- NORML -RRB- , which is in favor of marijuana legalization . On the environmental front , Nelson owns the bio-diesel brand Willie Nelson Biodiesel , which is made from vegetable oil . Nelson is also the honorary chairman of the Advisory Board of the Texas Music Project , the official music charity of the state of Texas . \", 'id': 'Willie_Nelson'}\n",

Nelson presented the finished material to Columbia executives , who were dubious about releasing an album that they at first thought was a demo . However , Nelson had creative control , so no further production was added .   A concept album , Red Headed Stranger is about a fugitive on the run from the law after killing his wife and her lover . The content consists of songs with brief poetic lyrics and arrangements of older material such as Fred Rose 's `` Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain '' , Wolfe Gilbert 's `` Down Yonder '' and Juventino Rosas ' `` O'er the Waves '' . Despite Columbia 's doubts and the limited instrumentation , Red Headed Stranger was a blockbuster among country music and mainstream audiences .

It shares a border with England to the south , and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean , with the North Sea to the east and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the south-west . In addition to the mainland , the country is made up of more than 790 islands , including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides .   The Kingdom of Scotland emerged as an independent sovereign state in the Early Middle Ages and continued to exist until 1707 . By inheritance in 1603 , James VI , King of Scots , became King of England and King of Ireland , thus forming a personal union of the three kingdoms . Scotland subsequently entered into a political union with the Kingdom of England on 1 May 1707 to create the new Kingdom of Great Britain . The union also created a new Parliament of Great Britain , which succeeded both the Parliament of Scotland and the Parliament of England . In 1801 , Great Britain itself entered into a political union with the Kingdom of Ireland to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland .   Within Scotland , the monarchy of the United Kingdom has continued to use a variety of styles , titles and other royal symbols of statehood specific to the pre-union Kingdom of Scotland . The legal system within Scotland has also remained separate from those of England and Wales and Northern Ireland ; Scotland constitutes a distinct jurisdiction in both public and private law . The continued existence of legal , educational , religious and other institutions distinct from those in the remainder of the UK have all contributed to the continuation of Scottish culture and national identity since the 1707 union with England .   In 1997 , a Scottish Parliament was re-established , in the form of a devolved unicameral legislature comprising 129 members , having authority over many areas of domestic policy . Scotland is represented in the United Kingdom Parliament by 59 MPs and in the European Parliament by 6 MEPs . Scotland is also a member of the British -- Irish Council , and sends five elected representatives to the British -- Irish Parliamentary Assembly . ', 'id': 'Scotland'}\n",

The album received great acclaim and earned Wilson his first Grammy Award , later being featured in several `` greatest albums '' lists .   The project was originally conceived in 1966 as Smile , a concept album recorded by the Beach Boys written in collaboration between Wilson and lyricist Van Dyke Parks . It was intended to succeed the group 's 11th studio album Pet Sounds and was based on the engineering methods of their single `` Good Vibrations '' . Many years after the project was shelved due to personal and technical difficulties with recording , Wilson chose to revisit the material with Parks as a specially arranged live concert performance . Motivated by the unexpected positive reception , a studio-recorded version was then released by Wilson as a solo album .   Recorded from scratch , Brian Wilson Presents Smile eschews the Beach Boys ' Smile sessions by containing all-new instrumental and vocal performances .

After bandleader Brian Wilson abandoned large portions of music recorded over a ten-month period , the band substituted its release with Smiley Smile -LRB- 1967 -RRB- , an album containing stripped-down remakes of some Smile material . Some of the original Smile tracks eventually found their way onto subsequent Beach Boys ' studio and compilation albums . As more fans learned of the project 's origins , details of its recordings acquired considerable mystique , and it was later acknowledged as the most legendary unreleased album in the history of popular music .   Working with lyricist Van Dyke Parks , Smile was composed as a multi-thematic concept album , existing today in its unfinished and fragmented state as an unordered series of abstract musical vignettes . Its genesis came during the recording of Pet Sounds , when Wilson began recording a new single , `` Good Vibrations '' . The track was created by an unprecedented recording technique : over 90 hours of tape was recorded , spliced , and reduced into a three-minute pop song . It quickly became the band 's biggest international hit yet ; Smile was to be produced in a similar fashion . Wilson touted the album as `` a teenage symphony to God '' , incorporating a range of music styles including psychedelic , doo-wop , barbershop singing , ragtime , yodeling , early American folk , classical music , and avant-garde explorations into noise and musical acoustics . Its projected singles were `` Heroes and Villains '' , a Western musical comedy , and `` Vega-Tables '' , a satire of physical fitness .   The album 's collapse has been attributed to several personal , technical , and legal issues which surrounded its making . The majority of its backing tracks were completed between August and December 1966 . A deadline set for January 1967 was missed , and Parks soon distanced himself from the project . In June , the Beach Boys reconvened at Brian 's makeshift home studio to record Smiley Smile . Many attempts were then made to complete the original Smile , most of which were derailed by Wilson , who became psychologically traumatized by the album . It was in the 1980s when bootlegged tracks from Smile began circulating widely among record collectors , encouraging others to assemble their own versions using what surviving recordings were available . The potential of what Smile could have been inspired many musicians , particularly those in indie rock , while the album 's saga became a touchstone for chamber pop and the more art-inclined sectors of post-punk .   As a solo artist , Wilson reinterpreted the project for concert performances in 2004 , and then followed up with the studio album Brian Wilson Presents Smile . Although he had ostensibly completed the work , Wilson clarified that his 2004 arrangement differed substantially from how he had first conceptualized the album during the 1960s . On October 31 , 2011 , The Smile Sessions was released containing an approximation of what the Beach Boys ' completed Smile might have sounded like based on the structure of Brian Wilson Presents Smile . It received universal acclaim . In 2012 , the compilation was ranked number 381 in Rolling Stone 's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list . In 2013 , it won the Best Historical Album award at the 55th Grammy Awards . \", 'id': 'Smile_-LRB-The_Beach_Boys_album-RRB-'}\n",

The latter events were dramatized in the biographical film Love & Mercy -LRB- 2014 -RRB- , in which Landy is portrayed by Paul Giamatti .   As a teenager , Landy aspired to show business , briefly serving as an early manager for George Benson . During the 1960s , he began studying psychology , earning his doctorate at the University of Oklahoma . After moving to Los Angeles , he treated many celebrity clients , including musician Alice Cooper and actors Richard Harris , Rod Steiger , Maureen McCormick , and Gig Young . He also developed an unorthodox 24-hour therapy intended to stabilize his patients by micromanaging their lives with a team of counselors and doctors .   Brian Wilson initially became a patient under Landy 's program in 1975 . Landy was soon discharged due to his burdensome fees . In 1983 , Landy was re-employed as Wilson 's therapist , subsequently becoming his executive producer , business manager , co-songwriter , and business adviser . Landy went on to co-produce Wilson 's debut solo album and allegedly ghostwrote portions of Wilson 's disowned memoir Would n't It Be Nice : My Own Story . In 1989 , Landy agreed to let the state of California revoke his professional license amidst accusations of ethical violations and patient misconduct .

After signing with Capitol Records in 1962 , Wilson wrote or co-wrote more than two dozen Top 40 hits for the group . Because of his unorthodox approaches to song composition and arrangement and mastery of recording techniques , he is widely acknowledged , by critics and musicians alike , as one of the most innovative and influential creative forces in popular music .   In the mid-1960s , Wilson composed , arranged and produced Pet Sounds -LRB- 1966 -RRB- , considered one of the greatest albums ever made . The intended follow-up to Pet Sounds , Smile , was canceled for various reasons , which included Wilson 's deteriorating mental health . As he suffered repeated nervous breakdowns , Wilson 's contributions to the Beach Boys diminished , and his erratic behavior led to tensions with the band . Following a court-ordered removal from the care of psychologist Eugene Landy , Wilson started receiving conventional medical treatment , and in the late 1990s , he began performing and recording consistently as a solo artist . He remains a member of the Beach Boys ' corporation , Brother Records Incorporated .   Wilson is considered a major innovator in the field of music production , the principal originator of the California Sound , one of the first music producer auteurs , and one of the most famous examples of the outsider musician . Only 21 years old when he received the freedom to produce his own records with total creative autonomy , he ignited an explosion of like-minded California producers , supplanting New York as the center of popular records , and becoming the first rock producer to use the studio as its own instrument . Wilson effectively set a precedent that allowed bands and artists to enter a recording studio and act as their own producers or co-producers . His songs became inextricably tied with the zeitgeist of the early 1960s , and he helped develop the sound of the wistful Flower Power era that proceeded . In later years , Wilson was regarded as a `` godfather '' to an era of indie musicians who were inspired by his melodic sensibilities , chamber pop orchestrations , and recording explorations .   His honors include being inducted into the 1988 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and winning Grammy Awards for Brian Wilson Presents Smile -LRB- 2004 -RRB- and The Smile Sessions -LRB- 2011 -RRB- . In lists published by Rolling Stone , Wilson ranked 52 for the `` 100 Greatest Singers of All Time '' in 2008 and 12 for the `` 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time '' in 2015 . In 2012 , music publication NME ranked Wilson number 8 in its `` 50 Greatest Producers Ever '' list , elaborating `` few consider quite how groundbreaking Brian Wilson 's studio techniques were in the mid-60s '' . He is an occasional actor and voice actor , having appeared in television shows , films , and other artists ' music videos . His life was portrayed in the 2014 biopic Love & Mercy , which received a wide release in 2015 . \", 'id': 'Brian_Wilson'}\n",

The group launched the careers of guitarists Eric Clapton , Jimmy Page and Jeff Beck , all of whom ranked in the top five of Rolling Stone magazine 's list of 100 greatest guitarists .   A blues-based band noted for their signature `` rave-up '' instrumental breaks , the Yardbirds broadened their range into pop , pioneering psychedelic rock and early hard rock ; and contributed to many electric guitar innovations of the mid-1960s , such as feedback , distortion and `` fuzztone '' . The bulk of the band 's most successful self-written songs came from vocalist and harmonica player Keith Relf , drummer Jim McCarty and bassist and producer Paul Samwell-Smith , who , with rhythm guitarist and bassist Chris Dreja , constituted the core of the group .   The band 's influence on both the music of the times and genres to come was great , and they inspired a host of imitators such as the Count Five and The Shadows of Knight . Rock critics and historians credit the Yardbirds with heavily contributing , if not inventing , `` the birth of psychedelic music `` and sowing the seeds of punk rock , progressive rock and heavy metal , among other genres .   After the Yardbirds broke up in 1968 , lead guitarist Jimmy Page founded what became Led Zeppelin , while Relf and McCarty formed the symphonic rock group Renaissance . The Yardbirds reformed in the 1990s , featuring McCarty , Dreja and new members . They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992 .

The group consisted of guitarist Jimmy Page , singer Robert Plant , bassist and keyboardist John Paul Jones , and drummer John Bonham . The band 's heavy , guitar-driven sound , rooted in blues and psychedelia on their early albums , has earned them recognition as one of the progenitors of heavy metal , though their unique style drew from a wide variety of influences , including folk music .   After changing their name from the New Yardbirds , Led Zeppelin signed a deal with Atlantic Records that afforded them considerable artistic freedom . Although the group was initially unpopular with critics , they achieved significant commercial success with albums such as Led Zeppelin -LRB- 1969 -RRB- , Led Zeppelin II -LRB- 1969 -RRB- , Led Zeppelin III -LRB- 1970 -RRB- , Led Zeppelin IV -LRB- 1971 -RRB- , Houses of the Holy -LRB- 1973 -RRB- , and Physical Graffiti -LRB- 1975 -RRB- . Their fourth album , which features the track `` Stairway to Heaven '' , is among the most popular and influential works in rock music , and it helped to secure the group 's popularity .   Page wrote most of Led Zeppelin 's music , particularly early in their career , while Plant generally supplied the lyrics . Jones ' keyboard-based compositions later became central to the group 's catalogue , which featured increasing experimentation . The latter half of their career saw a series of record-breaking tours that earned the group a reputation for excess and debauchery . Although they remained commercially and critically successful , their output and touring schedule were limited during the late 1970s , and the group disbanded following Bonham 's death from alcohol-related asphyxia in 1980 . In the decades that followed , the surviving members sporadically collaborated and participated in one-off Led Zeppelin reunions . The most successful of these was the 2007 Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert in London , with Jason Bonham taking his late father 's place behind the drums .   Led Zeppelin are widely considered one of the most successful , innovative , and influential rock groups in history . They are one of the best-selling music artists in the history of audio recording ; various sources estimate the group 's record sales at 200 to 300 million units worldwide . With RIAA-certified sales of 111.5 million units , they are the second-best-selling band in the US . Each of their nine studio albums placed in the top 10 of the Billboard album chart and six reached the number-one spot . They achieved eight consecutive UK number-one albums . Rolling Stone magazine described them as `` the heaviest band of all time '' , `` the biggest band of the Seventies '' , and `` unquestionably one of the most enduring bands in rock history '' . They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995 ; the museum 's biography of the band states that they were `` as influential '' during the 1970s as the Beatles were during the 1960s . \", 'id': 'Led_Zeppelin'}\n",

Buckingham Palace became the London residence of the British monarch on the accession of Queen Victoria in 1837 .   The last major structural additions were made in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , including the East front , which contains the well-known balcony on which the royal family traditionally congregates to greet crowds . The palace chapel was destroyed by a German bomb during World War II ; the Queen 's Gallery was built on the site and opened to the public in 1962 to exhibit works of art from the Royal Collection .   The original early 19th-century interior designs , many of which survive , include widespread use of brightly coloured scagliola and blue and pink lapis , on the advice of Sir Charles Long . King Edward VII oversaw a partial redecoration in a Belle Époque cream and gold colour scheme . Many smaller reception rooms are furnished in the Chinese regency style with furniture and fittings brought from the Royal Pavilion at Brighton and from Carlton House .

Kazakhstan is the dominant nation of Central Asia economically , generating 60 % of the region 's GDP , primarily through its oil/gas industry . It also has vast mineral resources .   Kazakhstan is officially a democratic , secular , unitary , constitutional republic with a diverse cultural heritage . Kazakhstan shares borders with Russia , China , Kyrgyzstan , Uzbekistan , and Turkmenistan , and also adjoins a large part of the Caspian Sea . The terrain of Kazakhstan includes flatlands , steppe , taiga , rock canyons , hills , deltas , snow-capped mountains , and deserts . Kazakhstan has an estimated 18 million people , Given its large land area , its population density is among the lowest , at less than 6 people per square kilometre -LRB- 15 people per sq. mi . -RRB- . The capital is Astana , where it was moved in 1997 from Almaty , the country 's largest city .   The territory of Kazakhstan has historically been inhabited by nomadic tribes . This changed in the 13th century , when Genghis Khan occupied the country as part of the Mongolian Empire . Following internal struggles among the conquerors , power eventually reverted to the nomads . By the 16th century , the Kazakh emerged as a distinct group , divided into three jüz -LRB- ancestor branches occupying specific territories -RRB- . The Russians began advancing into the Kazakh steppe in the 18th century , and by the mid-19th century , they nominally ruled all of Kazakhstan as part of the Russian Empire . Following the 1917 Russian Revolution , and subsequent civil war , the territory of Kazakhstan was reorganised several times . In 1936 , it was made the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic , part of the Soviet Union .   Kazakhstan was the last of the Soviet republics to declare independence during the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 . The current President , Nursultan Nazarbayev , has been leader of the country since then , and is characterised as authoritarian , with a government history of human rights abuses and suppression of political opposition . Kazakhstan has worked to develop its economy , especially its dominant hydrocarbon industry . Human Rights Watch says that `` Kazakhstan heavily restricts freedom of assembly , speech , and religion , '' and other human rights organisations regularly describe Kazakhstan 's human rights situation as poor .   Kazakhstan 's 131 ethnicities include Kazakhs -LRB- 63 % of the population -RRB- , Russians , Uzbeks , Ukrainians , Germans , Tatars , and Uyghurs .
